# Machine-Learning--In-brief
**So what is Machine Learning?**<br>
In lamen language, we feed data to the machine, the machine learns from that data. When a new set of data is provided then based on that learning, the machine makes a decision and prediction.<br><br>

In ***supervised learning*** the data is labelled (i.e every input data is tagged to its corresponding output). The machine is trained with those outputs to make a decision.
For instance, at school, the teacher first guided us and taught us how the specific problem is solved and accordingly we work on other problems.<br><br> 

In ***unsupervised learning*** the data is not labelled. The machine has to figure out the given data and must find hidden patterns in order to make prediction. A grown-up like you and me. We don't need guidance to help in our daily activity. We figure out things on our own.<br><br>

***Reinforcement Learning*** Suppose, you were dropped in an isolated island. You will have to learn how to live on the island, adapt to the changing climate, what to eat and what not to eat. So basically, you are following the hit and trial concept because you are new to the surrounding and only way for you to learn is to learn from your experience.<br>
*Reinorcement* is a learning method where an agent interacts with its environment by doing some actions and discover errors and rewards.

# Feature Engineering
Data Science project is not just about creating models. Any time you bulid a machine learnig model, you have to preprocess the data so that model can be trained in the right way.
